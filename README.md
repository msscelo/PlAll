# Plall

So, I wanted to execute git pull on a lot of different projects at the same time..

That's about it, maybe someday I will make this generate reports about outdated repos or something like that.

# Installation

```
pip install GitPython
```

# Usage

```
python main.py
```

To also run the git gc command use this:
```
python main.py gc
```
